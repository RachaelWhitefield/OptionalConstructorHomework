// Contains a constructor, Letter.  Should be able to either display an underlying character or a blank placeholder
// the constructor should define: a string value for the letter
// a boolean value that stores whether a letter has been guessed yet
// a function that returnes the underlying character if the letter has been guessed or a placeholder if the letter has not been guessed
// a function that takes a character as an argument and checks it against the underlying character, updating the stored boolean value to true if it was guessed correctly
